This is the code repository for [Hands-On C++ Game Animation Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/business-other/hands-on-game-animation-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781800208087), published by Packt.

**Learn modern animation techniques from theory to implementation with C++ and OpenGL**

## What is this book about?
Animation is one of the most important parts of any game. Modern animation systems work directly with track-driven animation and provide support for advanced techniques such as inverse kinematics (IK), blend trees, and dual quaternion skinning.
This book will walk you through everything you need to get an optimized, production-ready animation system up and running, and contains all the code required to build the animation system.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Get the hang of 3D vectors, matrices, and transforms, and their use in game development
* Discover various techniques to smoothly blend animations
* Get to grips with GLTF file format and its design decisions and data structures
* Design an animation system by using animation tracks and implementing skinning
* Optimize various aspects of animation systems such as skinned meshes, clip sampling, and pose palettes

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
if (test expression)
{
  Statement upon condition is true
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for professional, independent, and hobbyist developers interested in building a robust animation system from the ground up. Some knowledge of the C++ programming language will be helpful.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
